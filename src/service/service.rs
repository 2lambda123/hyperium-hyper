///
/// A `Service` is a function of a `Request`. It immediately returns a
/// `Future` representing the eventual completion of processing the
/// request. The actual request processing may happen at any time in the
/// future, on any thread or executor. The processing may depend on calling
/// other services. At some point in the future, the processing will complete,
/// and the `Future` will resolve to a response or error.
///
/// At a high level, the `Service::call` function represents an RPC request. The
/// `Service` value can be a server or a client.

    /// Responses given by the service.
    type Response;

    /// Errors produced by the service.

    ///
    /// This function is expected to be callable off task. As such,
    /// implementations should take care to not call `poll_ready`.
    ///
    /// Before dispatching a request, `poll_ready` must be called and return
    /// `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))`.
    ///
    /// # Panics

    /// Implementations are permitted to panic if `call` is invoked without
    /// obtaining `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` from `poll_ready`.
